# Planting Zone Finder

As an intermediate gardener who has recently moved to a new state I knew that I needed to look up the hardiness zone of my area which would inform me of what plants I should be planting outdoors. Since I am also an intermediate software engineer, I wanted to test my skills by going through my past projects from my coding bootcamp and re-making them in a way that more directly expresses my interests while also challenging me to practice writing new code.

THe Planting Zone Finder app calls on the Phzmapi API and then displays the zone, the average minimum temperature range, lattitude amd longitude of the zip code that was entered. Once the user has this information, that can make smmarter decisions about what plants they buy for their landscaping purposes.
